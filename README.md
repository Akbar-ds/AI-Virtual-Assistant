## Overview
Developed an AI virtual assistant to empower users with efficient task management, personalized assistance, and accessibility features, while advancing AI research and fostering innovation in human-computer interaction.

## Motivation
I thought of making this project while enjoying my vacations as I was interacting with my phone's assistant my motivation to build this project was multifaceted, driven by the desire to create a tool that enhances human-computer interaction and addresses specific needs in various domains.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10.0. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Scope

* Implement more sophisticated NLU models
* Enhanced Personalization
* Integration with IoT Devices
* Front-End
